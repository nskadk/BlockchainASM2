### Command Line Interface
Launch the CLI for programmatic access:
```bash
python launcher.py cli [command] [options]
```

Available commands:
```bash
# Wallet operations
python launcher.py cli createwallet
python launcher.py cli listaddresses
python launcher.py cli getbalance -address [ADDRESS]

# Blockchain management
python launcher.py cli createblockchain -address [ADDRESS]
python launcher.py cli printchain
python launcher.py cli validatechain

# Transaction operations
python launcher.py cli send -from [FROM] -to [TO] -amount [AMOUNT]
python launcher.py cli showmempool
python launcher.py cli mine -address [MINER_ADDRESS]

# Security testing
python launcher.py cli tamper -block [HASH] -type [transaction|nonce|timestamp]

# Network operations
python launcher.py cli startnode -port [PORT]
```

### Python API
Use the blockchain programmatically:
```python
from core.blockchain import Blockchain
from core.wallet import Wallet
from core.transaction import Transaction
from core.utxo import UTXOSet

# Create wallet
wallet = Wallet()
address = wallet.get_address()

# Initialize blockchain
blockchain = Blockchain("blockchain.db", address)

# Create and process transaction
utxo_set = UTXOSet(blockchain)
tx = Transaction.new_utxo_transaction(from_addr, to_addr, amount, utxo_set)
blockchain.add_to_mempool(tx, utxo_set)

# Mine block
block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions(miner_address)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Proof of Work Consensus
The mining algorithm implements Bitcoin-style Proof of Work:
- SHA256 hash function for block validation
- Configurable difficulty with automatic adjustment
- Nonce-based mining process
- Economic incentives through block rewards

### UTXO Transaction Model
Transactions follow Bitcoin's UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model:
- Each transaction input references a previous output
- Digital signatures prove ownership of funds
- Double-spending prevention through output tracking
- Balance calculation via UTXO aggregation

### Cryptographic Security
Multiple layers of cryptographic protection:
- ECDSA signatures on SECP256k1 curve for transaction authorization
- SHA256 hashing for block integrity and chain linkage
- Merkle trees for efficient transaction verification
- Base58 address encoding with checksums

### Network Protocol
Peer-to-peer networking features:
- WebSocket-based communication protocol
- Transaction and block broadcasting
- Chain synchronization with longest-chain rule
- Peer discovery and connection management

## Testing
